# taolib
A library for complex autonomous robot movement in the VEX Robotics Competition (VRC).

taolib combines many motion control algorithms such as [PID feedback control](https://renegaderobotics.org/pid-beginners-guide/), [Odometry](http://thepilons.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Tracking.pdf), and [Pure Pursuit](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fS4KaYXb7F1YQjP9lu66p511gsIPZWFe?usp=sharing#scrollTo=mx9nirOrLlN3) into an easy-to-use library with as little setup as possible, allowing the creation of complex and accurate autonomous routines.
