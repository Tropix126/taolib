- [ ] Finish refactoring to polymorphic odometry types
  - [x] Tracking Wheel Class
  - [ ] Parallel encoder odometry
  - [ ] 3 Wheel odometry
  - [ ] 2 Wheel perpendicular odometry
- [ ] DifferentialDrive class
  - [ ] Calculate pure pursuit linear velocity based on waypoint curvature.
  - [ ] Pivot turns
- [ ] Holonomic drivetrain support
- [ ] Possibly split pure pursuit-related things out of `tao::math` and into their own classes.
- [ ] Better tolerance/settling handling
- [ ] Better logger stuff
- [ ] Vision following? idk
- [ ] Catmull-rom spline generation for pursuit paths
  - [ ] Possibly generate at compile time?
